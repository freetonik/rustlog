<p>Now that you're familiar with <a href="/2018/09/a-simple-introduction-to-proof-by-contradiction/">direct proof and proof by contradiction</a>, it's time to discover a powerful technique of proof by induction.</p>
<p><em>Aside: do not confuse mathematical induction with inductive or deductive reasoning. Despite the name, mathematical induction is actually a form of deductive reasoning.</em></p>
<p>Let's say, we want to prove that some statement \(P\) is true for all positive integers. In other words:</p>
<p>\(P(1)\) is true, \(P(2)\) is true, \(P(3)\) is true... etc.</p>
<p>We could try and prove each one directly or by contradiction, but the infinite number of positive integers makes this task rather grueling. Proof by induction is a sort of generalization that starts with the basis:</p>
<p><strong>Basis:</strong> Prove that \(P(1)\) is true.</p>
<p>Then makes one generic step that can be applied indefinitely:</p>
<p><strong>Induction step:</strong> Prove that for all \(n\geq1\), the following statement holds: If \(P(n)\) is true, then \(P(n+1)\) is also true.</p>
<p>See what we did there? We've devised another problem to solve, and it's seemingly the same. But if the basis is true, then proving this <em>inductive step</em> will prove the theorem.</p>
<p>To do this, we chose an arbitrary \(n\geq1\) and assume that \(P(n)\) is true. This assumption is called the <em>inductive hypothesis</em>. The tricky part is this: we don't prove the hypothesis directly, but prove the \(n+1\) version of it.</p>
<p>This is all rather amorphous, so let's prove a real theorem.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1.</strong> For all positive integers \(n\), the following is true:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{equation}</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Start with the basis when \(n\) is \(1\). Just calculate it:</p>
<p>\[ 1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2}. \]</p>
<p>This is correct, so, the basis is proven. Now, assume that the theorem is true for any \(n\geq1\):</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2}
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>In the induction step we have to prove that it's true for \(n+1\):</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3}
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n+1) = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Having this equation, we should just try to expand it and prove directly. Since the last member on the left side is \(n+1\), the second last must be \(n\), so:</p>
<p>\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n + 1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n + (n+1) \]</p>
<p>From our assumption, we know, that</p>
<p>\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}. \]</p>
<p>So, let's replace it on the right hand side:</p>
<p>\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n + 1) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n+1) \]</p>
<p>And then make that addition so that the right hand side is a single fraction:</p>
<p>\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n + 1) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{2(n+1)}{2} \]</p>
<p>\[ = \frac{n(n+1) + 2(n+1)}{2} \]</p>
<p>\[ = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}. \]</p>
<p>Done, we have proven that the inductive step (\ref{eq:3}) is true.</p>
<p>There are two results:</p>
<ol>
<li>The theorem is true for \(n=1\).</li>
<li>If the theorem is true for any \(n\), then it's also true for \(n+1\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Combining these two results we can conclude that the theorem is true for all positive integers \(n\).</p>
<hr />
<p>I had troubles with this technique because for a long time I couldn't for the life of me understand why is this <em>enough</em> and how is the basis <em>helping</em>?! The basis seemed redundant. We assume \(P(n)\) is true, then prove that \(P(n+1)\) is true given that \(P(n)\) is true, but so what? We didn't prove the thing we assumed!</p>
<p>It clicked after I understood that we don't have to prove \(P(n)\), we just take the concrete value from the basis and use it as \(n\). Since we have a proof of \(P(n+1)\) being true <strong>if</strong> \(P(n)\) is true, we conclude that if \(P(1)\) is true, then \(P(1+1)\) is true.</p>
<p>Well, if \(P(1+1)\) is true, then, using the same idea, \(P(1+1+1)\) is true, and so forth.</p>
<p>The basis was the cheat-code to kick-start the process by avoiding the need to prove the assumption \ref{eq:2}.</p>
