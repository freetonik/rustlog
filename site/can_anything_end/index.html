    <h1>Can anything end?</h1>
    <p>Seems like nothing in the XXI century is capable of ending properly. Financial crises<sup>1</sup> start and then just linger. Pandemics start and then remain constantly in the background, normalized by virtue of being a &quot;thing&quot; long enough. War in the middle of Europe â€” will it ever really end?</p>

    print &quot;hi&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Was it always like this? Maybe, historical events seem to have clear endings only visible through a thick prism of <a href="https://quantum.country/qcvc">time</a>.</p>

<p>At least TV shows have finales. I want a finale for world events.</p>
