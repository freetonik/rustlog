    <h1>80 characters limit is wrong</h1>
    <p>I believe the 80-characters (or any other number) line limit for text to be wrong. Not archaic or irrelevant, but wrong. It violates a fundamental idea of computer science: separating layers of abstraction.</p>
<p>Not talking about code today, although, I don't think a strict limit is a good thing there either, for other reasons. I'm talking about human text.</p>
<p>Many programmers stick to the 80-characters line length limit while writing documentation, emails, etc. Emacs and other editors even have special modes or plugins for automatic hard wrapping.</p>
<p>Often, results look like so:</p>
<p><img src="email.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Without hard-wrapping, this email had a chance to look normal everywhere. Any app can interpret and present it in any way. With hard-wrapping though, this email can only look normal in certain conditions. Namely, a certain lower limit for window width.</p>
<p>Imagine joining a web project and seeing a <code>users</code> database table with values like <code>&lt;strong&gt;Jason Norwig&lt;/strong&gt;</code>. Your reaction might include profanity, because mixing data and presentation is wrong. Person's name (data) and its presentation (HTML) are different layers of abstraction.</p>
<p>Hard-wrapping lines by inserting <code>\n</code> symbols where they don't have any semantic meaning is the same sin. The whole character return thing was relevant in a context where data was inseparable from presentation: typewriters and paper.</p>
<p>A key argument for hard-wrapping goes something like this: &quot;modern screens are too wide, it's uncomfortable to read long lines&quot;. But modern screens come with modern apps, which can handle presentation to your preference. By modern I mean &quot;developed after the '70s&quot;. Text editors (including vim and Emacs) have been able to soft-wrap lines at arbitrary comfortable column for decades.</p>
<p>If your text presentation tool can't present text to your preference, consider replacing it. Moving this responsibility into data itself is not a solution.</p>
<p>So can we please<br>
stop doing this<br>
to each other.</p>
